# Implementation Plan: [Project Name]

## Overview
[1-2 paragraph summary of what's being built and why]

## Features Summary

| Feature ID | GitHub Issue | Feature Document | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|------------|--------------|------------------|----------|------------|--------|
| FEAT-001   | [#123](link) | [feature-name.md](path) | High | Low | Pending |

## Recommended Build Sequence

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
**Feature:** [FEAT-001](requirements/features/feature-name.md) | [#123](github-issue-link)
**Status:** Pending

#### Rationale
- Why build this first
- What patterns it establishes
- Dependencies it creates/resolves

#### Implementation Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...

#### Deliverables
- [ ] File/component 1
- [ ] File/component 2

---

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
**Feature:** [FEAT-002](requirements/features/feature-name.md) | [#124](github-issue-link)
**Status:** Pending

#### Rationale
- Why this phase follows the previous
- What it builds upon

#### Implementation Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two

#### Deliverables
- [ ] File/component 1
- [ ] File/component 2
