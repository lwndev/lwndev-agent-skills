# Executing Chores

Execute chore task workflows with systematic tracking from branch creation through pull request.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "execute chore", "implement this chore", or "run the chore workflow"
- User references a chore document in `requirements/chores/`
- User wants to implement documented maintenance work
- Continuing chore work that was previously started

## Quick Start

1. Locate chore document in `requirements/chores/`
2. Extract Chore ID and review acceptance criteria
3. Check for linked GitHub issue (update if exists)
4. Create git branch: `chore/CHORE-XXX-description`
5. Execute the defined changes, tracking with todos
6. Commit changes with descriptive messages
7. Verify acceptance criteria are met
8. Run tests/build verification
9. Create pull request
10. Update GitHub issue with PR link (if issue exists)

## Workflow Checklist

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Chore Execution:
- [ ] Locate chore document (get Chore ID)
- [ ] Post GitHub issue start comment (if issue exists)
- [ ] Create git branch: chore/CHORE-XXX-description
- [ ] Load acceptance criteria into todos
- [ ] Execute defined changes
- [ ] Commit with chore(category): message format
- [ ] Verify acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Run tests/build verification
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Update GitHub issue with PR link (if exists)
```

See [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) for detailed guidance on each step.

## Branch Naming

Format: `chore/CHORE-XXX-{2-4-word-description}`

- Uses Chore ID (not GitHub issue number) for consistent naming
- Description should be lowercase with hyphens
- Keep description brief but descriptive (2-4 words)

Examples:
- `chore/CHORE-001-update-dependencies`
- `chore/CHORE-002-fix-readme-typos`
- `chore/CHORE-003-cleanup-unused-imports`

## Commit Message Format

Format: `chore(category): brief description`

Categories: `dependencies`, `documentation`, `refactoring`, `configuration`, `cleanup`

Examples:
- `chore(dependencies): update typescript to 5.5`
- `chore(documentation): fix typos in README`
- `chore(cleanup): remove unused imports`

## Verification Checklist

Before creating the PR, verify:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria from chore document are met
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Changes match the scope defined in chore document
- [ ] No unintended side effects

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Task Type | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Chore already documented | Use this skill (`executing-chores`) |
| Chore needs documentation first | Use `documenting-chores`, then this skill |
| New feature with requirements | Use `documenting-features` -> `creating-implementation-plans` -> `implementing-plan-phases` |
| Quick fix (no tracking needed) | Direct implementation |
